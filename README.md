Desktop work/rest timer:

Desktop timer looping through work and rest time ranges you define. (works on Windows)

The timer has two main functions:
1. regular timer (upper bar)
2. work/rest timer (lower bar)

The work/rest timer allows the user to define a work time and a rest time. the timer will countback in a lop, constantly switching between work and rest time range supplied.  In the bottom right there is a label indicating if its work or rest time. 

Enjoy :)
